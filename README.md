# Pascallite-Compiler
This is a compiler made in C++ for a simplified version of the programming language Pascal. 
This was created for my CS 4301 Algorithmic Languages and Compilers course. The goal is to
create a compiler that functions just enough where a beginner programmer would be able to use
allowing the programmer to make assignments and do basic math. Due to time restraints within
the course loops are not included within the compiler, but that is the next goal to impliment.
